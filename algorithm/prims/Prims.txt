PSUEDOCODE FOR PRIMS ALGORITHM

1.  Make a queue (Q) with all the vertices of G (V);
2.  For each member of Q set the priority to INFINITY;
3.  Only for the starting vertex (s) set the priority to 0;
4.  The parent of (s) should be NULL;
5.  While Q isn’t empty
6.     Get the minimum from Q – let’s say (u); (priority queue);
7.     For each adjacent vertex to (v) to (u)
8.        If (v) is in Q and weight of (u, v) < priority of (v) then
9.           The parent of (v) is set to be (u)
10.          The priority of (v) is the weight of (u, v)
